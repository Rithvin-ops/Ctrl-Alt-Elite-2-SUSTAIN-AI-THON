**Brief Intro:**
      It makes use of hospital databases, mobile apps, user data and sensors to give real-time alerts and ensure productive health management via APIs, maps and cloud technologies. Sensors can be inserted in places like market, malls where people gather more. Data can also be collected from some private sensors by establishing partnership with the companies.

***Novelty***

The goal is to create a health monitoring system that gathers information from people, environmental sensors, and smartphone apps in order to identify illness outbreaks, alert users, and inform hospitals about available resources and health trends.
Creativity:In order to provide real-time alerts and guarantee effective health management through APIs, maps, and cloud technologies, it leverages hospital databases, mobile apps, user data, and sensors. In locations where people congregate more, such as markets and shopping centers, sensors can be installed. By partnering with the businesses, data can also be gathered from some private sensors.


**Solution:**

Create a system that tracks public health in smart cities using information from social media, mobile apps, and environmental sensors.  The system should optimize healthcare resources, identify illness outbreaks (such as flu or dengue) and send out real-time alerts, and link with wearable technology for ongoing health monitoring.
